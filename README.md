# handy-hero-node-be

I will be creating a back end to my handy hero project using,
    1. Express
    2. Typescript
    3. xata

I haven't used Typescript before with express, and this is the first time I'm working with xata.
So the main goal of this project is to be comfortable with these new technologies.
